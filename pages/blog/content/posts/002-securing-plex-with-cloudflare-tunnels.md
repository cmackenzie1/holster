**Update 2022-09-16**: After publishing this post I've received a few comments saying it is against Cloudflare ToS to
stream video using Cloudflare Tunnels.

I use a paid zone plan which is not subject to the same limitations as the free plans. Your mileage may vary.
Plex was used an as example but this process applies for _ANY self-hosted application you want to secure_.

## Introduction

![Plex Logo](/img/plex-logo-full-color-on-black.png)

[Plex.tv](https://plex.tv) Media Server is an application to organize and stream your own personal library of videos,
audio and photos. Plex supports sharing your library with others on your local network. Plex even has the ability to
share your catalog over the public Internet through a feature
called [Remote Access](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200289506-remote-access/).

However, most people should be extremely cautious when deploying anything that is accessible over the public Internet.
Bots and hackers are continuously scanning IP addresses and well known ports for any opportunity to exploit services
using default usernames and password or take advantage
of [CVE's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) on out-of-date services to install
malware on your devices. ü¶†

Many new services have popped up over that last couple years that aim to solve the problems around exposing services
directly to the public Internet. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
and [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) just to mention a few of them.

In this post I will show you how you can harden your Plex server using Cloudflare Tunnels to ensure your server is safe
from direct attacks, no matter where it is hosted. For me, that means the old MacBook Pro sitting on the network rack in
my closet. Additionally, I will go into how you can secure it even further (to you only!) with Cloudflare Access.

### How do tunnels work?

A tunnel works by installing a client on your server and configuring it to establish a secure connection to
the upstream proxy. In this case I am using `cloudflared` and the upstream connection is Cloudflare's Edge Network. You
can then configure a route that is used to connect to your service, like `https://plex.example.com`.

![Cloudflare Tunnel Diagram](/img/cloudflared-tunnel-architecture.png)

When a user navigates to `https://plex.example.com`, Cloudflare will proxy the client connection to the tunnel created
between your origin server and Cloudflare. Cloudflare will also filter out any malicious traffic from ever reaching your
origin server. While this is great for protecting your site from malicious traffic, anyone who knows the URL can still
access your site! Enter: Cloudflare Zero Trust.

### Cloudflare Zero Trust

Again, while tunnels work great for getting your origin on the public Internet without poking any holes in your firewall
or forwarding ports on your router, anyone with the address can still access your Plex login page. The next step is
setting
up a product called Cloudflare Access to prevent anyone but you from accessing your Plex. Everyone else will be simply
met
with a Cloudflare "access denied" page.

![Cloudflare access denied page](/img/cloudflare-access-denied.png)

### Step 1: Create a free Cloudflare Zero Trust account

If you don't already have a Cloudflare account, head over
to [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/zero-trust-services/#overview) and create a free account.
The free tier is more than generous and covers everything we will do in this post.

### Step 2: Setting up the Tunnel

These instructions will be for macOS.
Visit [Cloudflare Developer Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) for
specific instructions for your OS.

#### Installing `cloudflared`

```bash
# Install cloudflared
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel login # this will open a browser for you to log in.
```

#### Configure `cloudflared`

```bash
# Ensure the config directory exists
mkdir -p ~/.cloudflared

# Create  a new tunnel. Be sure to save the output of this
# command as it contains the Tunnel UUID needed in the next steps.
cloudflared tunnel create plex

TUNNEL_UUID=<tunnelUUID>
cat << EOF >~/.cloudflared/config.yaml
tunnel: ${TUNNEL_UUID}
credentials-file: /Users/${USER}/.cloudflared/${TUNNEL_UUID}.json

ingress:
  - hostname: plex.example.com
    service: http://localhost:32400
  - service: http_status:404
EOF

# Install the service to run at login
cloudflared service install
```

#### Create a route for your tunnel

This will attach your tunnel to your provided hostname.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route plex plex.example.com
```

Go ahead and visit it to make sure it works!

### Step 3: Create a Cloudflare Access Application

Finally, to ensure only you can access your Plex origin server, create an Application from the Zero Trust Dash.

On the left hand navigation, **Access > Applications** and choose "Add an Application".

![Add an application](/img/cloudflare-access-add-an-application.png)

We are going to choose the "Self-hosted" option. Enter your specific details below and click "Next".

![Self-hosted application details](/img/cloudflare-access-new-self-hosted-application.png)

Enter a Policy name, keep "Allow" as the rule action then go ahead and scroll down to the "Create additional rules"
section. Choose the "Email" option from the dropdown and enter your email on the right.

![Attach an access policy](/img/cloudflared-access-new-app-policy-email.png)

Choose "Next" again then go ahead and click "Add application". After that the application should show up in your
dashboard.

Finally, head on over to the route you configured for your tunnel `https://plex.example.com` and enter the same email
you entered when creating the application policy. You should then receive a code in your email. After entering that code
you will be taken directly to your Plex server!üòå

### Step 4: Relax and Enjoy üçø

Grab some popcorn, your favorite beverage, and relax knowing your Plex server is secure. üòå

### Summary

Using Cloudflare Tunnels with Cloudflare Access is an incredible combination to keep your entire stack secure, not just
Plex. I personally use this to gate access to PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, SSH and even my Unifi network controller. You can
go even further and define access policies that can be reused across several Cloudflare Access Applications.
